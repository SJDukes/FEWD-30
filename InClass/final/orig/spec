setup a form with 3 inputs so that we can find parks using the following criteria
- zip code
- park type
- dog type

Use google search api (or something like it) to find the locations
* I would like it to search after each input (like a filter)


use localStorage.setItem to store the following or remove the following values as you modify
the input fields:
- zip code
- park type
- dog type
